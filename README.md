Projects to re-learn python after a long hiatus

## Background 
Wow, so I didn't think I would have to do this again. Alas, I will have to relearn python again after nearly a decade gap. To make this efficient and fun, I've decided to take advantage of recent advanced in AI/ML - the LLM solutions. So, I asked ChatGPT and Claude.AI to generate a list of 50 projects that will help me relearn python. The specific prompt I used is below:

> Create a series of 50 computer science projects to learn the Python programming language. The projects should help me develop into an expert software engineer. The projects should slowly increase in complexity to help me increase my skillset gradually. The projects should be within the context of core programming and software engineering capability, ideally centered around the subjects of machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, biostatistics, and application development. Ideally, each project should not take more than 3 weeks to complete and may also build upon previous projects. Finally, the projects should help me learn core tools that a software engineer employs in their job (ex. docker, git).
